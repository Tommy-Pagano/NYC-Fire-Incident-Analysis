# NYC-Fire-Incident-Analysis
This is a visualization and analysis of NYC fire incident data from 2002-2024

I am looking at the severity of structural fires in NYC in relation to external factors, such as fire houses present in area, median home value in area, and population. I am also looking at response times along median home value.

Fire severity is judged by the "Highest Alarm Level" which indicates the maximum alarms dispatched throughout the course of the incident. Every increasing alarm level indicates that responders at the scene need more manpower and resources to control the fire.
